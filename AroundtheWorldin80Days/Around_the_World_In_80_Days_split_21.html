</span>
<p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre4">    While these events were passing at the opium-house, Mr. Fogg, unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer, was quietly escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter, making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions. He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity, and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion, who was confused by his patience and generosity:</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "It is in the interest of my journey—a part of my programme."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined at a sumptuously served table-d'hote; after which Aouda, shaking hands with her protector after the English fashion, retired to her room for rest. Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The Times and Illustrated London News.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been not to see his servant return at bedtime.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    But, knowing that the steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning, he did not disturb himself about the matter.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    When Passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his master's bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying the least vexation, contented himself with taking his carpet-bag, calling Aouda, and sending for a palanquin.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was then eight o'clock; at half-past nine, it being then high tide, the Carnatic would leave the harbour. Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow, and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He had expected to find not only the steamer, but his domestic, and was forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face, and he merely remarked to Aouda, "It is an accident, madam; nothing more."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr. Fogg: "Were you not, like me, sir, a passenger by the Rangoon, which arrived yesterday?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I was, sir," replied Mr. Fogg coldly. "But I have not the honour—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Do you know where he is, sir?" asked Aouda anxiously.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "What!" responded Fix, feigning surprise. "Is he not with you?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "No," said Aouda. "He has not made his appearance since yesterday.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Without you, madam?" answered the detective. "Excuse me, did you intend to sail in the Carnatic?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes, sir."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed. The Carnatic, its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated time, without any notice being given; and we must now wait a week for another steamer."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    As he said "a week" Fix felt his heart leap for joy. Fogg detained at Hong Kong for a week! There would be time for the warrant to arrive, and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law. His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say, in his placid voice,</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But there are other vessels besides the Carnatic, it seems to me, in the harbour of Hong Kong."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start. Fix, stupefied, followed; it seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well. For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail. Fix began to hope again.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search, resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Is your honour looking for a boat?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Have you a boat ready to sail?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes, your honour; a pilot-boat—No. 43—the best in the harbour."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Does she go fast?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Between eight and nine knots the hour. Will you look at her?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Your honour will be satisfied with her. Is it for a sea excursion?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "No; for a voyage."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "A voyage?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes, will you agree to take me to Yokohama?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and said,</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Is your honour joking?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "No. I have missed the Carnatic, and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I am sorry," said the sailor; "but it is impossible."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Are you in earnest?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Very much so."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea, evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far. Fix was in mortal suspense.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, "You would not be afraid, would you, madam?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Not with you, Mr. Fogg," was her answer.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The pilot now returned, shuffling his hat in his hands.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Well, pilot?" said Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Well, your honour," replied he, "I could not risk myself, my men, or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year. Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Only sixteen hundred," said Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "It's the same thing."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Fix breathed more freely.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But," added the pilot, "it might be arranged another way."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Fix ceased to breathe at all.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "How?" asked Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and would aid us."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Pilot," said Mr. Fogg, "I must take the American steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Why not?" returned the pilot. "The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama. It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts from Shanghai."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You are sure of that?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Perfectly."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And when does the boat leave Shanghai?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "On the 11th, at seven in the evening. We have, therefore, four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And you could go—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "It is a bargain. Are you the master of the boat?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes; John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Would you like some earnest-money?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "If it would not put your honour out—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Here are two hundred pounds on account sir," added Phileas Fogg, turning to Fix, "if you would like to take advantage—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Very well. In half an hour we shall go on board."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But poor Passepartout?" urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by the servant's disappearance.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I shall do all I can to find him," replied Phileas Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat, the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout's description, and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him. The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there, they returned to the wharf.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was now three o'clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Her shining copper sheathing, her galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable. Her two masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races. The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who were familiar with the Chinese seas. John Bunsby, himself, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance, would have inspired confidence in the most timid.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already installed. Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The accommodation was confined, but neat.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you," said Mr. Fogg to Fix, who bowed without responding.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "It's certain," thought he, "though rascal as he is, he is a polite one!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout. Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued. But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    John Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the Tankadere, taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, and standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves.</div>

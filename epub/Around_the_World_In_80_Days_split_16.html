<p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre4">    The train entered the station, and Passepartout jumping out first, was followed by Mr. Fogg, who assisted his fair companion to descend.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong steamer, in order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the voyage.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him, and said,</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Mr. Phileas Fogg?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I am he."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Is this man your servant?" added the policeman, pointing to Passepartout.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Be so good, both of you, as to follow me."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever. The policeman was a representative of the law, and law is sacred to an Englishman.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout tried to reason about the matter, but the policeman tapped him with his stick, and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to obey.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "May this young lady go with us?" asked he.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "She may," replied the policeman.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri, a sort of four-wheeled carriage, drawn by two horses, in which they took their places and were driven away. No one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    They first passed through the "black town," with its narrow streets, its miserable, dirty huts, and squalid population; then through the "European town," which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions, shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts, where, although it was early morning, elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house, which, however, did not have the appearance of a private mansion.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The policeman having requested his prisoners for so, truly, they might be called-to descend, conducted them into a room with barred windows, and said: "You will appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past eight."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He then retired, and closed the door.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Why, we are prisoners!" exclaimed Passepartout, falling into a chair.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Aouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg:</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Sir, you must leave me to my fate! It is on my account that you receive this treatment, it is for having saved me!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    There was some mistake. Moreover, he would not, in any event, abandon Aouda, but would escort her to Hong Kong.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But the steamer leaves at noon!" observed Passepartout, nervously.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "We shall be on board by noon," replied his master, placidly.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to himself, "Parbleu that's certain! Before noon we shall be on board." But he was by no means reassured.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    At half-past eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, and, requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining hall.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was evidently a court-room, and a crowd of Europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Immediately after, Judge Obadiah, a fat, round man, followed by the clerk, entered. He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail, and put it hurriedly on his head.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "The first case," said he. Then, putting his hand to his head, he exclaimed, "Heh! This is not my wig!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "No, your worship," returned the clerk, "it is mine."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "My dear Mr. Oysterpuff, how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk's wig?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The wigs were exchanged.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout was getting nervous, for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "The first case," repeated Judge Obadiah.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Phileas Fogg?" demanded Oysterpuff.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I am here," replied Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Passepartout?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Present," responded Passepartout.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Good," said the judge. "You have been looked for, prisoners, for two days on the trains from Bombay."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But of what are we accused?" asked Passepartout, impatiently.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You are about to be informed."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I am an English subject, sir," said Mr. Fogg, "and I have the right—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Have you been ill-treated?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Not at all."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Very well; let the complainants come in."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    A door was swung open by order of the judge, and three Indian priests entered.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "That's it," muttered Passepartout; "these are the rogues who were going to burn our young lady."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The priests took their places in front of the judge, and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against Phileas Fogg and his servant, who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You hear the charge?" asked the judge.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes, sir," replied Mr. Fogg, consulting his watch, "and I admit it."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You admit it?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I admit it, and I wish to hear these priests admit, in their turn, what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand what was said.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes," cried Passepartout, warmly; "at the pagoda of Pillaji, where they were on the point of burning their victim."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The judge stared with astonishment, and the priests were stupefied.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "What victim?" said Judge Obadiah. "Burn whom? In Bombay itself?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Bombay?" cried Passepartout.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Certainly. We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji, but of the pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And as a proof," added the clerk, "here are the desecrator's very shoes, which he left behind him."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "My shoes!" cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The confusion of master and man, who had quite forgotten the affair at Bombay, for which they were now detained at Calcutta, may be imagined.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Fix the detective, had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout's escapade gave him, and, delaying his departure for twelve hours, had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill. Knowing that the English authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour, he promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward to Calcutta by the next train. Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow, Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before Mr. Fogg and his servant, the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive. Fix's disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined. He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive, accompanied by a young woman, whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain. He hastened for a policeman; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied, he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room, watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta, as it had done at Bombay and Suez.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout's rash exclamation, which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "The facts are admitted?" asked the judge.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Admitted," replied Mr. Fogg, coldly.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Inasmuch," resumed the judge, "as the English law protects equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people, and as the man Passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay, on the 20th of October, I condemn the said Passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Three hundred pounds!" cried Passepartout, startled at the largeness of the sum.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Silence!" shouted the constable.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And inasmuch," continued the judge, "as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant, and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive. Passepartout was stupefied. This sentence ruined his master. A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because he, like a precious fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda!</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced. Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he rose, and said, "I offer bail."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You have that right," returned the judge.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Fix's blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I will pay it at once," said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on the clerk's desk.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison," said the judge. "Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Come!" said Phileas Fogg to his servant.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But let them at least give me back my shoes!" cried Passepartout angrily.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!" he muttered, as they were handed to him.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides, they pinch my feet."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by the crestfallen Passepartout. Fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued forth on Mr. Fogg's traces. That gentleman took a carriage, and the party were soon landed on one of the quays.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head. Eleven o'clock was striking;</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance of time. Fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with disappointment.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "The rascal is off, after all!" he exclaimed. "Two thousand pounds sacrificed!</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He's as prodigal as a thief! I'll follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is going on, the stolen money will soon be exhausted."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Since leaving London, what with travelling expenses, bribes, the purchase of the elephant, bails, and fines, Mr. Fogg had already spent more than five thousand pounds on the way, and the percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives, was rapidly diminishing.</div>

<p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre4">    Fix soon rejoined Passepartout, who was lounging and looking about on the quay, as if he did not feel that he, at least, was obliged not to see anything.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Well, my friend," said the detective, coming up with him,</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "is your passport visaed?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Ah, it's you, is it, monsieur?" responded Passepartout.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Thanks, yes, the passport is all right."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And you are looking about you?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    So this is Suez?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In Egypt?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Certainly, in Egypt."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And in Africa?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In Africa."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In Africa!" repeated Passepartout. "Just think, monsieur, I had no idea that we should go farther than Paris; and all that I saw of Paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning, between the Northern and the Lyons stations, through the windows of a car, and in a driving rain! How I regret not having seen once more Pere la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysees!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You are in a great hurry, then?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I am not, but my master is. By the way, I must buy some shoes and shirts.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    We came away without trunks, only with a carpet-bag."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Really, monsieur, you are very kind."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    And they walked off together, Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Above all," said he; "don't let me lose the steamer."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You have plenty of time; it's only twelve o'clock."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout pulled out his big watch. "Twelve!" he exclaimed;</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "why, it's only eight minutes before ten."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Your watch is slow."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "My watch? A family watch, monsieur, which has come down from my great-grandfather! It doesn't vary five minutes in the year.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It's a perfect chronometer, look you."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I see how it is," said Fix. "You have kept London time, which is two hours behind that of Suez. You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I regulate my watch? Never!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Well, then, it will not agree with the sun."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "So much the worse for the sun, monsieur. The sun will be wrong, then!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture. After a few minutes silence, Fix resumed:</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You left London hastily, then?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I rather think so! Last Friday at eight o'clock in the evening, Monsieur Fogg came home from his club, and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But where is your master going?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Always straight ahead. He is going round the world."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Round the world?" cried Fix.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes, and in eighty days! He says it is on a wager; but, between us, I don't believe a word of it. That wouldn't be common sense.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    There's something else in the wind."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Ah! Mr. Fogg is a character, is he?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I should say he was."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Is he rich?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "No doubt, for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him. And he doesn't spare the money on the way, either: he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And you have known your master a long time?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Why, no; I entered his service the very day we left London."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined. The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg; his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet—all confirmed Fix in his theory.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He continued to pump poor Passepartout, and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master, who lived a solitary existence in London, was said to be rich, though no one knew whence came his riches, and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits. Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez, but was really going on to Bombay.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Is Bombay far from here?" asked Passepartout.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Pretty far. It is a ten days' voyage by sea."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And in what country is Bombay?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "India."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In Asia?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Certainly."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "The deuce! I was going to tell you there's one thing that worries me— my burner!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "What burner?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "My gas-burner, which I forgot to turn off, and which is at this moment burning at my expense. I have calculated, monsieur, that I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours, exactly sixpence more than I earn; and you will understand that the longer our journey—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Did Fix pay any attention to Passepartout's trouble about the gas? It is not probable. He was not listening, but was cogitating a project.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout and he had now reached the shop, where Fix left his companion to make his purchases, after recommending him not to miss the steamer, and hurried back to the consulate. Now that he was fully convinced, Fix had quite recovered his equanimity.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Consul," said he, "I have no longer any doubt. I have spotted my man.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Then he's a sharp fellow," returned the consul, "and counts on returning to London after putting the police of the two countries off his track."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "We'll see about that," replied Fix.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But are you not mistaken?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I am not mistaken."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Why was this robber so anxious to prove, by the visa, that he had passed through Suez?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Why? I have no idea; but listen to me."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation with Passepartout.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In short," said the consul, "appearances are wholly against this man.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    And what are you going to do?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Send a dispatch to London for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched instantly to Bombay, take passage on board the Mongolia, follow my rogue to India, and there, on English ground, arrest him politely, with my warrant in my hand, and my hand on his shoulder."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Having uttered these words with a cool, careless air, the detective took leave of the consul, and repaired to the telegraph office, whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the London police office.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    A quarter of an hour later found Fix, with a small bag in his hand, proceeding on board the Mongolia; and, ere many moments longer, the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea.</div>

</a>
</span>
<p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre4">    Having won twenty guineas at whist, and taken leave of his friends, Phileas Fogg, at twenty-five minutes past seven, left the Reform Club.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout, who had conscientiously studied the programme of his duties, was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour; for, according to rule, he was not due in Saville Row until precisely midnight.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg repaired to his bedroom, and called out, "Passepartout!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout did not reply. It could not be he who was called; it was not the right hour.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Passepartout!" repeated Mr. Fogg, without raising his voice.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout made his appearance.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I've called you twice," observed his master.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But it is not midnight," responded the other, showing his watch.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I know it; I don't blame you. We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Monsieur is going to leave home?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes," returned Phileas Fogg. "We are going round the world."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Round the world!" he murmured.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In eighty days," responded Mr. Fogg. "So we haven't a moment to lose."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But the trunks?" gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head from right to left.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "We'll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    We'll buy our clothes on the way. Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, and some stout shoes, though we shall do little walking. Make haste!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout tried to reply, but could not. He went out, mounted to his own room, fell into a chair, and muttered:</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "That's good, that is! And I, who wanted to remain quiet!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Around the world in eighty days! Was his master a fool? No.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Was this a joke, then? They were going to Dover; good!</div>
<div class="calibre4">    To Calais; good again! After all, Passepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again. Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt— but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this so domestic person hitherto!</div>
<div class="calibre4">    By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg was quite ready. Under his arm might have been observed a red-bound copy of Bradshaw's Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide, with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He took the carpet-bag, opened it, and slipped into it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes, which would pass wherever he might go.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You have forgotten nothing?" asked he.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Nothing, monsieur."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "My mackintosh and cloak?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Here they are."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Good! Take this carpet-bag," handing it to Passepartout.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Take good care of it, for there are twenty thousand pounds in it."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout nearly dropped the bag, as if the twenty thousand pounds were in gold, and weighed him down.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Master and man then descended, the street-door was double-locked, and at the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing Cross. The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight. Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master, who, after paying the cabman, was about to enter the station, when a poor beggar-woman, with a child in her arms, her naked feet smeared with mud, her head covered with a wretched bonnet, from which hung a tattered feather, and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl, approached, and mournfully asked for alms.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist, and handed them to the beggar, saying, "Here, my good woman.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    I'm glad that I met you;" and passed on.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes; his master's action touched his susceptible heart.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased, Mr. Fogg was crossing the station to the train, when he perceived his five friends of the Reform.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Well, gentlemen," said he, "I'm off, you see; and, if you will examine my passport when I get back, you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Oh, that would be quite unnecessary, Mr. Fogg," said Ralph politely.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "We will trust your word, as a gentleman of honour."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You do not forget when you are due in London again?" asked Stuart.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In eighty days; on Saturday, the 21st of December, 1872, at a quarter before nine p.m. Good-bye, gentlemen."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class carriage at twenty minutes before nine; five minutes later the whistle screamed, and the train slowly glided out of the station.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The night was dark, and a fine, steady rain was falling.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg, snugly ensconced in his corner, did not open his lips.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout, not yet recovered from his stupefaction, clung mechanically to the carpet-bag, with its enormous treasure.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Just as the train was whirling through Sydenham, Passepartout suddenly uttered a cry of despair.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "What's the matter?" asked Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Alas! In my hurry—I—I forgot—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "What?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "To turn off the gas in my room!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Very well, young man," returned Mr. Fogg, coolly; "it will burn— at your expense."</div>

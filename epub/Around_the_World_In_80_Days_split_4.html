<p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg, having shut the door of his house at half-past eleven, and having put his right foot before his left five hundred and seventy-five times, and his left foot before his right five hundred and seventy-six times, reached the Reform Club, an imposing edifice in Pall Mall, which could not have cost less than three millions. He repaired at once to the dining-room, the nine windows of which open upon a tasteful garden, where the trees were already gilded with an autumn colouring; and took his place at the habitual table, the cover of which had already been laid for him. His breakfast consisted of a side-dish, a broiled fish with Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel of Cheshire cheese, the whole being washed down with several cups of tea, for which the Reform is famous. He rose at thirteen minutes to one, and directed his steps towards the large hall, a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    A flunkey handed him an uncut Times, which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate operation.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The perusal of this paper absorbed Phileas Fogg until a quarter before four, whilst the Standard, his next task, occupied him till the dinner hour.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Dinner passed as breakfast had done, and Mr. Fogg re-appeared in the reading-room and sat down to the Pall Mall at twenty minutes before six.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Half an hour later several members of the Reform came in and drew up to the fireplace, where a coal fire was steadily burning.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    They were Mr. Fogg's usual partners at whist: Andrew Stuart, an engineer;</div>
<div class="calibre4">    John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, bankers; Thomas Flanagan, a brewer; and Gauthier Ralph, one of the Directors of the Bank of England— all rich and highly respectable personages, even in a club which comprises the princes of English trade and finance.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Well, Ralph," said Thomas Flanagan, "what about that robbery?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Oh," replied Stuart, "the Bank will lose the money."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "On the contrary," broke in Ralph, "I hope we may put our hands on the robber. Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent, and he'll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But have you got the robber's description?" asked Stuart.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In the first place, he is no robber at all," returned Ralph, positively.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "What! a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds, no robber?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "No."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Perhaps he's a manufacturer, then."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers, who made this remark. He bowed to his friends, and entered into the conversation.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The affair which formed its subject, and which was town talk, had occurred three days before at the Bank of England. A package of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds, had been taken from the principal cashier's table, that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence. Of course, he could not have his eyes everywhere. Let it be observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public. There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at the mercy of the first comer. A keen observer of English customs relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He took it up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the next man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour. Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his head. But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly. The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the "drawing office," the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss. As soon as the robbery was discovered, picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, New York, and other ports, inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds, and five per cent. on the sum that might be recovered. Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left London by rail, and a judicial examination was at once entered upon.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    There were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph said, that the thief did not belong to a professional band. On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a well-to-do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed. A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom Ralph was one, did not despair of his apprehension.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The papers and clubs were full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was especially agitated, several of its members being Bank officials.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity. But Stuart was far from sharing this confidence; and, as they placed themselves at the whist-table, they continued to argue the matter. Stuart and Flanagan played together, while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner. As the game proceeded the conversation ceased, excepting between the rubbers, when it revived again.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I maintain," said Stuart, "that the chances are in favour of the thief, who must be a shrewd fellow."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Well, but where can he fly to?" asked Ralph. "No country is safe for him."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Pshaw!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Where could he go, then?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Oh, I don't know that. The world is big enough."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "It was once," said Phileas Fogg, in a low tone. "Cut, sir," he added, handing the cards to Thomas Flanagan.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The discussion fell during the rubber, after which Stuart took up its thread.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "What do you mean by `once'? Has the world grown smaller?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Certainly," returned Ralph. "I agree with Mr. Fogg. The world has grown smaller, since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago. And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And also why the thief can get away more easily."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Be so good as to play, Mr. Stuart," said Phileas Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    But the incredulous Stuart was not convinced, and when the hand was finished, said eagerly: "You have a strange way, Ralph, of proving that the world has grown smaller. So, because you can go round it in three months—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "In eighty days," interrupted Phileas Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "That is true, gentlemen," added John Sullivan. "Only eighty days, now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, has been opened.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Here is the estimate made by the Daily Telegraph:</div>
<div class="calibre4">    From London to Suez via Mont Cenis and Brindisi, by rail and steamboats…. 7 days From Suez to Bombay, by steamer…. 13 "</div>
<div class="calibre4">    From Bombay to Calcutta, by rail… 3 "</div>
<div class="calibre4">    From Calcutta to Hong Kong, by steamer… 13 "</div>
<div class="calibre4">    From Hong Kong to Yokohama (Japan), by steamer…. 6 "</div>
<div class="calibre4">    From Yokohama to San Francisco, by steamer… 22 "</div>
<div class="calibre4">    From San Francisco to New York, by rail… 7 "</div>
<div class="calibre4">    From New York to London, by steamer and rail…. 9 " —— Total…. 80 days."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes, in eighty days!" exclaimed Stuart, who in his excitement made a false deal. "But that doesn't take into account bad weather, contrary winds, shipwrecks, railway accidents, and so on."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "All included," returned Phileas Fogg, continuing to play despite the discussion.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But suppose the Hindoos or Indians pull up the rails," replied Stuart; "suppose they stop the trains, pillage the luggage-vans, and scalp the passengers!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "All included," calmly retorted Fogg; adding, as he threw down the cards,</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Two trumps."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Stuart, whose turn it was to deal, gathered them up, and went on:</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You are right, theoretically, Mr. Fogg, but practically—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Practically also, Mr. Stuart."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I'd like to see you do it in eighty days."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "It depends on you. Shall we go?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Heaven preserve me! But I would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey, made under these conditions, is impossible."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Quite possible, on the contrary," returned Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Well, make it, then!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "The journey round the world in eighty days?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I should like nothing better."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "When?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "At once. Only I warn you that I shall do it at your expense."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "It's absurd!" cried Stuart, who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend. "Come, let's go on with the game."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Deal over again, then," said Phileas Fogg. "There's a false deal."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand; then suddenly put them down again.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Well, Mr. Fogg," said he, "it shall be so: I will wager the four thousand on it."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Calm yourself, my dear Stuart," said Fallentin. "It's only a joke."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "When I say I'll wager," returned Stuart, "I mean it." "All right," said Mr. Fogg; and, turning to the others, he continued:</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baring's which I will willingly risk upon it."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Twenty thousand pounds!" cried Sullivan. "Twenty thousand pounds, which you would lose by a single accidental delay!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "The unforeseen does not exist," quietly replied Phileas Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But, Mr. Fogg, eighty days are only the estimate of the least possible time in which the journey can be made."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "A well-used minimum suffices for everything."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But, in order not to exceed it, you must jump mathematically from the trains upon the steamers, and from the steamers upon the trains again."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I will jump—mathematically."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "You are joking."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "A true Englishman doesn't joke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager," replied Phileas Fogg, solemnly.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours, or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes. Do you accept?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "We accept," replied Messrs. Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flanagan, and Ralph, after consulting each other.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Good," said Mr. Fogg. "The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine. I will take it."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "This very evening?" asked Stuart.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "This very evening," returned Phileas Fogg. He took out and consulted a pocket almanac, and added, "As today is Wednesday, the 2nd of October, I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club, on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine p.m.; or else the twenty thousand pounds, now deposited in my name at Baring's, will belong to you, in fact and in right, gentlemen. Here is a cheque for the amount."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties, during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure. He certainly did not bet to win, and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds, half of his fortune, because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult, not to say unattainable, project. As for his antagonists, they seemed much agitated; not so much by the value of their stake, as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The clock struck seven, and the party offered to suspend the game so that Mr. Fogg might make his preparations for departure.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I am quite ready now," was his tranquil response. "Diamonds are trumps: be so good as to play, gentlemen."</div>

</a>
</span>
<p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:0pt"> </p><p class="calibre4" style="margin:0pt; border:0pt; height:1em"> </p><div class="calibre4">    An hour after, the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and put to sea. During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire Island, and directed her course rapidly eastward.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    At noon the next day, a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessel's position. It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Not the least in the world. It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    As for Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    What had happened was very simple. Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body. This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henrietta was directing her course towards Liverpool.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was very clear, to see Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    How the adventure ended will be seen anon. Aouda was anxious, though she said nothing. As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg's manoeuvre simply glorious. The captain had said "between eleven and twelve knots," and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    If, then—for there were "ifs" still—the sea did not become too boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days, between the 12th and the 21st of December.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It is true that, once arrived, the affair on board the Henrietta, added to that of the Bank of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he imagined or could desire.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    During the first days, they went along smoothly enough. The sea was not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east, the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout was delighted. His master's last exploit, the consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him. Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow. He formed warm friendships with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats. He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    His loquacious good-humour infected everyone. He had forgotten the past, its vexations and delays. He only thought of the end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta. Often, also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old intimacy no longer existed.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him. He did not know what to think. For, after all, a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg's command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself in safety. The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as he was, took the greatest precautions. Mr. Fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, a dangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind. Ever since the evening before the barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the cold became sharper, and the wind veered to the south-east.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    This was a misfortune. Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the vessel's speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves of which broke against the stern. She pitched violently, and this retarded her progress.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest, and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout's visage darkened with the skies, and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright. But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept on his course, without even decreasing his steam. The Henrietta, when she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but passing safely.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour. It continued fresh, but, unhappily, it remained obstinately in the south-east, rendering the sails useless.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg's departure from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst localities had been passed. In summer, success would have been well-nigh certain.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad season. Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret, and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed them, they might still count on the steam.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began to speak earnestly with him. Without knowing why it was a presentiment, perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying. He finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heard his master say, "You are certain of what you tell me?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Certain, sir," replied the engineer. "You must remember that, since we started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, we haven't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I will consider," replied Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The coal was giving out! "Ah, if my master can get over that," muttered he, "he'll be a famous man!" He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Of course."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Ass!" replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world, and refrained.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt? It was difficult to imagine. Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him,</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke. The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Do not let the fires go down," replied Mr. Fogg.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Keep them up to the last. Let the valves be filled."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    He went to the poop, saying to himself, "He will be like a madman!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the poop-deck.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The bomb was Captain Speedy. It was clear that he was on the point of bursting. "Where are we?" were the first words his anger permitted him to utter. Had the poor man be an apoplectic, he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Where are we?" he repeated, with purple face.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool," replied Mr. Fogg, with imperturbable calmness.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Pirate!" cried Captain Speedy.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I have sent for you, sir—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Pickaroon!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "—sir," continued Mr. Fogg, "to ask you to sell me your vessel."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "No! By all the devils, no!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "But I shall be obliged to burn her."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Burn the Henrietta!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes; at least the upper part of her. The coal has given out."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Burn my vessel!" cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce the words. "A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Here are sixty thousand," replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a roll of bank-bills. This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy. An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars. The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment, and all his grudges against his passenger. The Henrietta was twenty years old; it was a great bargain. The bomb would not go off after all.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Mr. Fogg had taken away the match.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And I shall still have the iron hull," said the captain in a softer tone.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "The iron hull and the engine. Is it agreed?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Agreed."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned them to his pocket.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft! It was true, however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him,</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Don't let this astonish you, sir. You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds, unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    I missed the steamer at New York, and as you refused to take me to Liverpool—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "And I did well!" cried Andrew Speedy; "for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it!" He added, more sedately,</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Do you know one thing, Captain—"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Fogg."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Captain Fogg, you've got something of the Yankee about you."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    And, having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment, he was going away, when Mr. Fogg said, "The vessel now belongs to me?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Certainly, from the keel to the truck of the masts—all the wood, that is."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Very well. Have the interior seats, bunks, and frames pulled down, and burn them."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure, and on that day the poop, cabins, bunks, and the spare deck were sacrificed. On the next day, the 19th of December, the masts, rafts, and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily, keeping up the fires. Passepartout hewed, cut, and sawed away with all his might. There was a perfect rage for demolition.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The railings, fittings, the greater part of the deck, and top sides disappeared on the 20th, and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    By ten in the evening they were passing Queenstown. Phileas Fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to London; that length of time was necessary to reach Liverpool, with all steam on.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    And the steam was about to give out altogether!</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Sir," said Captain Speedy, who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg's project, "I really commiserate you. Everything is against you. We are only opposite Queenstown."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Ah," said Mr. Fogg, "is that place where we see the lights Queenstown?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Yes."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Can we enter the harbour?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Not under three hours. Only at high tide."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "Stay," replied Mr. Fogg calmly, without betraying in his features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer ill-fortune.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stop to put off the mails. These mails are carried to Dublin by express trains always held in readiness to start; from Dublin they are sent on to Liverpool by the most rapid boats, and thus gain twelve hours on the Atlantic steamers.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Instead of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the Henrietta, he would be there by noon, and would therefore have time to reach London before a quarter before nine in the evening.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbour at one o'clock in the morning, it then being high tide; and Phileas Fogg, after being grasped heartily by the hand by Captain Speedy, left that gentleman on the levelled hulk of his craft, which was still worth half what he had sold it for.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    The party went on shore at once. Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr. Fogg on the spot; but he did not. Why? What struggle was going on within him? Had he changed his mind about "his man"? Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake? He did not, however, abandon Mr. Fogg. They all got upon the train, which was just ready to start, at half-past one; at dawn of day they were in Dublin; and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer which, disdaining to rise upon the waves, invariably cut through them.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    Phileas Fogg at last disembarked on the Liverpool quay, at twenty minutes before twelve, 21st December. He was only six hours distant from London.</div>
<div class="calibre4">    But at this moment Fix came up, put his hand upon Mr. Fogg's shoulder, and, showing his warrant, said, "You are really Phileas Fogg?"</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I am."</div>
<div class="calibre4">    "I arrest you in the Queen's name!"</div>
